# AI Java car game
Artificial intelligence learns to drive a car by crashing it. The game is written in java!

The neural network was taken from here - https://github.com/kim-marcel/basic_neural_network

This project uses maven

# Binds

1,2,3,4,0 - speed of learning <br />
C - saving the best NeuranNetwork <br />
R - toggle ray render <br />
H - respawn cars <br />
UP - Increases the minimum number to show the connection between neurons <br />
DOWN - Reduces the minimum number to show the connection between neurons <br />

# Config

There are 2 neural network modes. <br /><br />
1 - at the output, one neuron, which is responsible for turning, learns very quickly, in 10 cycles, but the machine is always twitching. <br />
2 - there are 2 neurons at the output, it learns quite slowly, for ~ 10000 cycles, but the machine does not twitch
